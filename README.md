- 👋 Hi, I’m CorgiDev aka Erissa Duvall.
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, Accessibility, books (mostly fantasy/mythology and science fiction), music (very eclectic with a little bit of everything from Mongolian Death Metal to Classical Symphony), and more.
- 🌱 I’m always striving to learn something new everyday, but my biggest passion is learning new things about Accessibility, Diversity/Equality/Inclusion (DEI), and how to spread awareness of the need to improve all those things.
- 💞️ I don't have any collabs going on currently. Feel free to contact me with collab suggestions.
